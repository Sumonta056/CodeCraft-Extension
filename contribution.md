# Contributing to CodeCraft Extension

First off, thank you for considering contributing to CodeCraft Extension. It's people like you that make CodeCraft Extension such a great tool.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  - Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

## Making Changes

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  - This is usually the master branch.
  - Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
  - To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

## Submitting Changes

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the repository in the CodeCraft Extension organization.
- After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
